This small game is made in React. It shows an equation of the form X+Y+Z=P. Here, X, Y, and Z should be random numbers, and P should be the proposed answer. The user should be able to answer whether it is true that the sum of X, Y, and Z equals the proposed answer P. The user gets a point for each question the user answers correctly. The score is displayed in this format: [number of correct answers]/[number of questions answered]. Every time the user answers a question, a new question that uses randomly generated numbers is displayed.
